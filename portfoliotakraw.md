This is Nur Alif Ilyasa's Project showcase of:

# Humanoid Robot Soccer Body Frame Development using CFRP

## Background
This project owned by Ms. Putri Prastiwi Wulandari. 

## Development
The workflow of creating this parts are as follows:
1. Design
2. Mold Design
3. Preparing the mold
4. Molding
5. Cutting and drilling
6. Finishing

### Design
There are 2 design to be made, which are the parts and the casting mold. The part design is used as the mockup of the part. The casting mold is used to actually form the frame part.

In this research project we only created the frame for the body of the frame. This Humanoid body is separated in 3 parts. The main part is the most complex and the biggest part. There are 13 3D printed casting mold to form these 3 CFRP parts.


### Mold
To create the carbon fiber robot frame parts, a mold is needed to form the parts. The molds that we use are created by 3D printing. 

The 3D printed parts are usually not suitable for resin casting. We add a layer of clear smooth plastic tape and bees wax. This will avoid the part to stick with the mold, enabling it to be easily dettached.

### Molding
To create the mold a subsequent layers of carbon fiber sheets were layed on the casting mold. A resin is also rubbed on the carbon fiber sheets, enabling it to stick with the mold. After a subsequence layers of carbon fiber has been layed, we pressed the parts with the outer side of the mold, a screws and nuts is used to secure the mold. 12 hour later, the mold is ready and the mold is deteached from the mold leaving the hardened carbon fiber-plastic parts.

### Cutting and Drilling
The part from the mold has uneven edges, it is often sharp and can easily slice the skin. With personal protective equipment we cut the rough edges of the part using grinder. We also utilized CNC to cut and drill the parts for precise screw holes. 

### Finishing
After the part has the cut and holes needed, we finish the part with sanding, making sure that the parts is smooth, polished, and does not have harmfull rough edges or surface.

## Advantage in terms of development
In terms of development, the carbon fiber parts considered can have more complex shape compared with bended alumunium sheet made parts. Forming the part are also easier, excluding the need of heavy equipment like metal bender. To cut and drill a the part are also easy since it is not as strong and heavy as metals.

## Harm
However, developing a carbon fiber part poses a harmfull problem. This is apparent when cutting or drilling the cured parts. Cutting and drilling carbon fiber parts leaves harmfull dust particle. When working with cured parts we use personal protective equipment includings coat, protective googles, mask, and gloves.

## Performance
In terms of performance, the robot has not apparent difference with the allumunium body frame. A further research will be made since the scope of this research project is foccused on the body part of the frame, excluding the leg and the hand parts. However Carbon fiber reinforced plastic is a tensile material meaning it will back to its original form when a force has deformed the part.
